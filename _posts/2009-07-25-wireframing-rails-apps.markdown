A really useful way to mockup your applications before coding is to use wire framing software to create the screens and layout of your  application. By doing this, you can ensure everyone working on the project can help to decide upon what the first version should functionally look like, and everyone will know what the end goal should approximately look like. 

With this sort of discussion, you really need a tool that will just let you focus on the functional aspect, and avoid too much discussion about colors, branding, etc, all of which can come later.
