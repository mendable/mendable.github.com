I have been reading the book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/0141040017/">Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness</a> recently. 

The book talks about how "choice architects" can make small changes to the way choices are presented (in every day life) and have a huge impact on the choices that people make. 

What I found particularly interesting is how many of the idea's in the book can be taken and applied to the Internet and websites we build, helping guide users to the best choices and also increase conversion rates for the Website, creating a better experience for the user, increasing user retention rates, user satisfaction, and ultimately profitability for the business.

Highly recommended.
