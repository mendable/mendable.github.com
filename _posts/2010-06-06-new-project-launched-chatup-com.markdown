<a href="http://www.chatup.com/"><img src="/images/posts/chatup-logo.gif" alt="chatup logo" title="chatup logo" width="248" height="84" style="float:left; margin-right: 20px;" /></a>I have launched a new Ruby on Rails website, <a href="http://www.chatup.com/">ChatUp.com</a>. This is a personal project that i've been working on in my spare time with a little help from my girlfriend, and it's great to finally have it out there.

I've got some really cool stuff integrated, including Facebook authentication using the new OAuth2 API and HTML5 GeoLocation. Doing GeoLocation *well* and having it work for any user of the site turned out to be a bit tricky, i might post more on that later. Back end searching is done using the latest Sphinx search daemon and ThinkingSphinx plugin.

There are still 101 things I want to improve, i'm working on getting a new design for the blog sorted right now, but as an initial version 1 it does all the things you would expect of any dating site.

I'm going to be writing about my efforts to build out the site further, and probably more importantly how I actually am getting traffic to the website (let's face it, that's one of the hardest things to do, programming is easy).

If you want to follow the project along, please check out the <a href="http://www.chatup.com/blog">ChatUp Blog</a> and grab the RSS feed.

Please <a href="http://www.chatup.com/">check it out</a>, Feedback welcome!
